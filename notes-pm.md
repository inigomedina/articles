Ship the right thing, the right manner.

# What is the right thing

1.  Product is more than just the products.
    I've worked trying to put the focus on things that are related to the user and customer experience all around the products. For instance, I've found that we lack a good technical information, documentation, contents around Engine piece.

    I push a lot to give importance to contents and information.

    I push a lot to work in collaboration with support and solutions team, participating directly at the support tools, talking to clients and understanding how they use the products.

2.  Products are not bunkers.
    Usually Builder and Engine have been understood from a spatial perspective and not from a time perspective. I feel that they are different moments of a same experience. Some users, customers find enough the Builder moment, and others need some kind of dialectic between them: moving usually from builder to engine and viceversa.

    I push to work together all of people involved into product management, and not just each one into each bunker.

    I am pushing to understand that not all of features in Builder should be developed with all the attributes that other software has, and that in fact we need some kind of path to move users from Builder to Engine.


# What is the right manner

1. We need a way of managing product.

    I've started working with a system that starts from the needs and pains that people find, trying to resume this on a pain frame. Understanding after these pains and using a working backwards methodology, trying to see the final result and set up the steps from there.

    Wich that, we want to improbe the communication internaly. The horizon for any team at CARTO, being more aligned in terms of priorities and needs.

2.  We need a consistent way of shipping.

    When we release a library, we need to give documentation, announcement, examples, etc. around this, and not just ship this at Github, leaving all of the work to the support team.

    We need a consistent way of release cycle. We are now working with an alpha, beta, final release.

    We need a consistent way of versioning.


Above all I've been pushing to use our tools and, so say, eat our own food. We have people on support side, mainly, that are frequent users of our products, but we need that also on teams pretty involved into the product things: engineering, design, etc. We have weekly exercises related to maps and goals, and on that road we have been discovering a lot of pains and we have been developing a good empathy towards our customers.

-------------------------------------------

- Our pricing and business model has been focused on hardware attributes: cores, memory, etc. Not on functional aspects, so not on what you can do with our tools. How do you think about that?

- We have understood, along this time that the business is on the enterprise side. At the same time we have not developed features typical on enterprise side, like metrics. So, information that allows you to understand how do you use your platform, is there any problem, etc. What do you think about that?

- OnPremise has been usually the solution to any case that doesn't fit well into the cloud, standard services. How do you imagine our OnPremise?
