# Happy doing!

Everyday we learn. We do not need any special equipment for that. It just happens. We learn about our cities by walking down the street. We learn about sizes by looking at the tiny ants with an eye and at the magnificent trees with the other. We even learn about elusive things like love just by loving. And that learning is a kind of compass that guides us throughout all the days of our lives.

There is a kind of magic when something just happens. Things have their own life, their own order, their own rules. We humans are not the managers in there and we attend a show that seems to be beyond our abilities. How damn my body works well by itself? How damn cells manage to organize themselves? Who is steering the boat, our inward-looking anthropocentric view wonders.

# Innovation through experience

In 1962 Kenneth Arrow published his famous article _The Economic Implications of Learning by Doing_. As always, the great economist brought his voice to the page with a wonderful writing style: clear, concise, and honest. And once again he tried to tackle the tough questions enriching the economics perspective with contributions from other fields. That same year he published _Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Invention_ as well. Not bad.

With the first article Arrow laid the foundations of what we know as endogenous growth theory.
